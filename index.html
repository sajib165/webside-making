      <h4> I want to say something about myself</h4>
      <p>I'm SCA. I always like to learn something new and like to interact with new people. I want to interact with a
        lot
        of people and understand how they think. How does one think in a situation, where is his differernce with the
        other's thoughts, why did he think in this way. I like to do research on these.i like to tour. I have many
        friends
        who like to hang out with me. I like to travel to different historical places. When I see historical places, I
        think and these places help me anew. Once upon a time there were a lot of people in historical places, they left
        a
        lot for us, like <b> Today is not just for today, it is your existence for the future.</b> that's i belive.
