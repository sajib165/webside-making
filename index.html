      <h4> I want to say something about myself</h4>
      <p>I'm SCA. I always like to learn something new and like to interact with new people. I want to interact with a
        lot
        of people and understand how they think. How does one think in a situation, where is his differernce with the
        other's thoughts, why did he think in this way. I like to do research on these.i like to tour. I have many
        friends
        who like to hang out with me. I like to travel to different historical places. When I see historical places, I
        think and these places help me anew. Once upon a time there were a lot of people in historical places, they left
        a
        lot for us, like <b> Today is not just for today, it is your existence for the future.</b> that's i belive.

      <h2>Philosophical Issues in Quantum Theory</h2>
      <p>Despite its status as a core part of contemporary physics, there is no consensus among physicists or
        philosophers of physics on the question of what, if anything, the empirical success of quantum theory is telling
        us about the physical world. This gives rise to the collection of philosophical issues known as “the
        interpretation of quantum mechanics”. One should not be misled by this terminology into thinking that what we
        have is an uninterpreted mathematical formalism with no connection to the physical world. Rather, there is a
        common core of interpretation that consists of recipes for calculating probabilities of outcomes of experiments
        performed on systems subjected to certain state preparation procedures. What are often referred to as different
        “interpretations” of quantum mechanics differ on what, if anything, is added to the common core. Arguably, two
        of the major approaches, hidden-variables theories and collapse theories, involve formulation of physical
        theories distinct from standard quantum mechanics; this renders the terminology of “interpretation” even more
        inappropriate.

        Much of the philosophical literature connected with quantum theory centers on the problem of whether we should
        construe the theory, or a suitable extension or revision of it, in realist terms, and, if so, how this should be
        done. Various approaches to the “Measurement Problem” propose differing answers to these questions. There are,
        however, other questions of philosophical interest. These include the bearing of quantum nonlocality on our
        understanding of spacetime structure and causality, the question of the ontological character of quantum states,
        the implications of quantum mechanics for information theory, and the task of situating quantum theory with
        respect to other theories, both actual and hypothetical. In what follows, we will touch on each of these topics,
        with the main goal being to provide an entry into the relevant literature, including the Stanford Encyclopedia
        entries on these topics.</p>
